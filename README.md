## 🎯 Purpose  

This repo is meant for learning and practice — not a “finished project.”  
My goal: understand concepts fully and solve each exercise independently.

## ⚠️ Note  

**NO AI USED HERE (TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING!)**  
I solve each exercise myself to learn C++, not rely on AI or auto-generated code.
